# Angular 2 Project Management app for DevICT Presentation
This is a demo app written in Angular2 for Presentation at DevICT.
I started with a demo application by @deborahkurata from a PluralSight course - www.bit.ly/DeborahKsBlog

1) You'll need to install Node.JS (if you don't already have it): https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) Close the repo to your local machine

3) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory

4) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
5) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
